Now we have to write commands to configure module to ibeacon, 
as you see on picture i make program to do it for me.(when i test it i will upload here)
Open arduino ide, choose COM port (serial on mac) , open serial monitor and write these commands:

1. AT+RENEW Restores factory defaults

2. AT+RESET Reboot HM-10

3. AT Wait for OK

4. AT+MARJ0x1234 Set iBeacon Major number to 0x1234 (hexadecimal)  AT+MARJ0x002C   (0d0044)

5. AT+MINO0xFA01 Set iBeacon Minor number to 0xFA01 (hexadecimal)  AT+MINO0x0001

6. AT+ADVI5 Set advertising interval to 5 (546.25 milliseconds)

7. AT+NAMEDOPEY Set HM-10 module name to DOPEY. Make this unique.  AT+NAMEBEA01

8. AT+ADTY3 Make non-connectable (save power)

9. AT+IBEA1 Enable iBeacon mode

10.AT+DELO2 iBeacon broadcast-only (save power)

11.AT+PWRM0 Enable auto-sleep. This reduces power from 8 to 0.18 mA

12.AT+RESET Reboot

You can change major , minor and name of the commands. 
You can find more commands on this link: http://www.jnhuamao.cn/iBeacon_en.zip 
The ibeacon is made now. Just disconnect wires from ftdi and put battery on vcc and gnd


Wakeup HM-10
When the HM-10 is in auto-sleep mode, it will quickly go to sleep when powered up or rebooted. 
After sending it the AT+PWRM0 command and restarting it, the HM-10 will no longer respond to AT commands. 
To wake up the device, send it along line of random alphabetic characters which is 80 characters or more. It will wake up and respond with OK+WAKE. 
If you want to work with the device for awhile, send it an AT+PWRM1 command so it does not sleep on you. 
You can then send it an AT+PWRM0 when you are done to reduce power consumption. 
Have fun with your new iBeacon.
